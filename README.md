🚀 Azure Demand Forecasting – Milestone 1
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting Azure Compute and Storage demand using Machine Learning techniques.

Milestone 1 covers data collection, cleaning, and preparation to build a reliable dataset for future modeling.

📊 Datasets Used

azure_usage.csv – Simulated Azure compute & storage usage data

external_factors.csv – Economic indicators and cloud market demand data

🧼 Data Preparation

Converted date column to datetime format

Handled missing values using forward fill where required

Verified data types and cleaned column names

Merged internal Azure usage data with external factors using date

Sorted dataset for time-series consistency

📈 Key Insights

Multiple Azure regions analyzed

CPU and Storage usage trends observed

Active user variation studied

Economic index and market demand patterns identified

✅ Final Output

Cleaned and merged dataset saved for feature engineering and model development.

This dataset is ready for:

Lag feature creation

Time-series forecasting

Machine learning model training
